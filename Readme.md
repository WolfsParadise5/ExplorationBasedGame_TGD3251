PersoManage

Emnbark into a world as a person that have just moved into a new city, with a fixed amount of money only available, how would you get by around the set city you're in

This that could be done:
-> Explore the map
-> Go to different restraunts and shops
-> Rent properties

Things are still broken:
-> Food Selection
-> Buying ingredients and cooking your own food
-> Job can only be retrieved from the fire station
-> Investment bank unable to display all investments
